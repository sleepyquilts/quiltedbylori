I took my sampler quilt to Lori to get it quilted. The work that she did on it made my quilt shine beyond any expectation that I might have had. Would recommend her to anyone to polish their quilt to it's fullest potential. --Nicole Mather 

Lori is an amazing quilter. Great eye for the vision of the quilts. She has done 10 or more for me and everyone of them has turned out wonderful. --Ronda Schott Jackson

My quilt came out so, so beautiful. The quilting is impeccable! I will be back! --Darlene B Abbott-OBrien
