            &#34;I took my sampler quilt to Lori to get it quilted. The work that she did on it made my quilt shine beyond any expectation that I might have had. Would recommend her to anyone to polish their quilt to it's fullest potential.&#34;<br> -Nicole Mather

            &#34;Lori is an amazing quilter. Great eye for the vision of the quilts. She has done 10 or more for me and everyone of them has turned out wonderful.&#34; <br> -Ronda Schott Jackson

        <p id="aboutLori">
            Quilted By Lori was born when Lori started sewing when her daughter Megan was small. It started small as halloween costumes and pillowcases. However, as any crafter knows it only stays small for so long. Soon it became more and more blankets, quilts, pillows, and anything else she could think up. About seven years ago she realized that she was spending more money paying someone to quilt her quilts than it would cost to run her own business. Today Lori is the happy owner of Bertha, a Gammill Statler Longarm Quilting Machine.
